****72:React.memo(): Prevent Unnecessary Re-Renders with React Memo video 71****
In this video, we'll explore React.memo, a powerful tool to optimize your React applications by preventing unnecessary re-renders. You'll learn why React.memo is essential, how to implement it, and see it in action using React Profiler. Weâ€™ll also cover different ways to use React.memo in your app, ensuring better performance and a more efficient codebase. For example, we'll discuss how React.memo can help in a component-heavy dashboard app by only re-rendering components that need updating.



----------memo() in react 19 ---------------

---memorization---
React.memo
useMemo
useCallback
React.memo()

* The React.memo function is used for memoization of functional components.

* If the props of a memoized component have not changed, React skips the
rendering for that component, using the cached result instead.

* Do memoizations only when necessary.

OR

React.memo() is a higher-order component that we can use to wrap components that we do not want to re-render unless props within them changes





---why we we used to compilar-----
------------compilar in react-----------

summary :- to prevent the unnacceary re-rendering in react like when changing state and props .

import { useState } from "react";
import { Counts } from "./MemoCount";

export const ReactMemo = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <>
      <div className="p-4 h-52 font-display tracking-wider flex flex-col justify-end items-center">
        <h1>{count}</h1>
        <button className="btn bg-cyan-500 py-1 px-3" onClick={()=>setCount(count+1)}>Increment</button>
      </div>
      <Counts /> //re-render
    </>
  );
};

updated code of child elements 
import { memo, useRef } from "react";

export const Counts = () => {
  const renderCount = useRef(0);
  console.log(renderCount);

  return (
    <>
      <div className="mt-3 font-display text-center">
        <p className="">
          Nothing changed here but I have now rendered:{" "}
          <span className="text-red-600"> {renderCount.current++} time(s)</span>
        </p>
      </div>
    </>
  );
};

// to prevent to the re-render the child elements when parent element re-render
export default memo(Counts);


---------------another way 
import { memo, useRef } from "react";


export const Counts = memo(() => {
  const renderCount = useRef(0);
  console.log(renderCount);

  return (
    <>
      <div className="mt-3 font-display text-center">
        <p className="">
          Nothing changed here but I have now rendered:{" "}
          <span className="text-red-600"> {renderCount.current++} time(s)</span>
        </p>
      </div>
    </>
  );
});

// to prevent to the re-render the child elements when parent element re-render
// export default memo(Counts);
