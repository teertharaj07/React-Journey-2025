****64:Prop Drilling in React 19 with Animation & Practical Example******

In this video, we explore prop drilling in React 19, a common challenge when passing data through multiple components. Learn the concept with a clear animation, followed by a practical example that demonstrates how to implement prop drilling effectively. We'll also integrate Tailwind CSS for styling and dive deeper using developer tools. Perfect for developers looking to improve their React skills and optimize component communication. ðŸ’¸

============================



Prop Drilling in React JS

* Props drilling is a pattern in React where you pass data from a parent component to deeply nested child components through multiple layers of components, even if some of the intermediate components don't need the data. 

* As your component tree deepens, prop drilling can make the code more complex and harder to maintain. 


--------------------------

Problem with Prop Drilling 

App---> Counter--->ChildComponents
this is components  sturcute flow

there Counter -- childcomponrts want share data

This is how our component free
looks. ChildComponent is taking
props from Counter. 
This is fine here.


-----------------
Problem with Prop Drilling  

App---> Counter--->Child---->GrandChild--->GrandGrandChild
this is components  sturcute flow

there Counter -- GrandGrandChild want share data

Now, we need counter value in
GrandGrandChild, just passing
from Counter to GrandGrandChild
is not possible.


can we send the data directly imposible

so we will do that the data flow App--Counter--Child---GrandChild--Grand--GrandChild 

it means App to GrandGrandChild data share
this called prop drilling
---------------------------------

Problem with Prop Drilling  

App---> Counter--->Child---->GrandChild--->GrandGrandChild
this is components  sturcute flow

To fix this, we need to pass from
Counter > Child > GrandChild >
GrandGrandChild. Here, Child and
GrandChild doesn't need counter
state, but we still need to pass to it
just so that GrandGrandChild can
access it.

      Concluding Prop Drilling

* Passing upto or 2 levels is probably fine but might be harder to maintain
more than that.

* When a prop needs to be passed through many levels, making changes to the
component hierarchy or adding/removing props can become cumbersome.

* Prop drilling may result in boilerplate code as each intermediate component
needs to accept and pass down the props even if it doesn't use them.

* We will learn about fixing it in Next Video using ContextAPI. 4

export const ParentComponet = () => {
  //   return <h1>Hello ParentComponent</h1>;

  return (
    <section
      className={`p-4 h-lvh font-display tracking-wider flex flex-col justify-center items-center bg-white-900 text-white`}
    >
      <h1>Component A</h1>
      <ChildComponent data="React JS" />
    </section>

};

const ChildComponent = (props) => {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Hello , I am Component B</h1>
      <GrandChildComponent data={props.data} />

const GrandChildComponent = (prop) => {
  return (

    </>
