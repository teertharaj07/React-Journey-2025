user interfaces (Uls) and single-page applications.

confused if you read different notation in different places.
+ React knows only one thing that is to create an awesome Ul.
---------------------------------

Why React.js ? |
« Reactis declarative because it describes what the Ul should look like rather than how to achieve
it. This makes the code easier to read and maintain, as it is more focused on the end result rather
than the steps involved in getting there. |
* here ,we are manually cearting element,setting their properties,and appending them to the dom

====react declarative way 
----------------------------------
function MyComponet({name}){
    return <div> Hello,{name}!</div>;
}
