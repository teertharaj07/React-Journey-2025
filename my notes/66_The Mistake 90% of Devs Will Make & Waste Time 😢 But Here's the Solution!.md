summary :-

In the Context API, the data provided by a context can only be accessed by the components that are its children within the component tree. This means that any component that needs access to the context data must be a descendant of the provider component that supplies the context value.

ContextAPI - Notes

In the Context API, the data provided by a context can only be accessed by the components 
that are its children within the component tree. This means that any component that needs
access to the context data must be a descendant of the provider component that supplies 
the context value. 


export function App(){
 return (
    <>
      <BioProvider>
        <Home />
        <About />
        <Service />
      </BioProvider>
      
      
    </>
  );
};
