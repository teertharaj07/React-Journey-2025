*****98:React ProjectðŸ”¥Dynamic Accordion in React 19 p1*****
In this video, weâ€™ll walk through creating a dynamic accordion in React 19 that allows only one tab to stay open at a time, automatically closing the others. This is a step up from basic accordions, offering a more user-friendly experience. By the end, you'll understand how to use React components and state management to build a clean, efficient accordion. Perfect for modern web development projects like FAQs or content toggle sections. ðŸ’¸

How to Build a Accordion Using React v19
Accordions are a great way to organize content in a compact and user-friendly manner. They allow users to click on a heading (like a question) to reveal or hide the content beneath it (like the answer). In this post, Iâ€™ll guide you through the steps to create a simple accordion using React JS v19.

Steps to Build the Accordion

Create the Parent Accordion Component:

Import necessary hooks: Use useState and useEffect from React to manage state and effects.
Fetch FAQ data: Import your faq.json file or use sample data for the FAQ.
State for tracking the active FAQ: Create a state variable activeId using useState(null). This will store the ID of the currently active (opened) FAQ.
Function to toggle FAQ: Create a function handleToggle(id) that will:
If the clicked FAQ is already open, close it by setting activeId to null.
If another FAQ is clicked, open it by setting activeId to that FAQâ€™s ID.
Pass Data to the FAQ Component:

In the parent Accordion component, loop through the FAQ data using map().
For each FAQ, pass down:
The data (curData) for the current FAQ.
The current activeId to determine if the FAQ should be open or closed.
A function onToggle to handle when the FAQ is clicked.
Build the Child FAQ Component:

Props: Accept the curData, isActive, and onToggle as props.
Display FAQ Question: Show the question for the FAQ.
Toggle Button: Create a button that calls onToggle when clicked, toggling between "Show" and "Close".
Conditionally Show Answer: Use the isActive prop to determine if the answer should be visible. If isActive is true, display the answer; otherwise, keep it hidden.
Final Integration:

When a user clicks on an FAQ question, it toggles between open and closed.
Only one FAQ can be open at a time. If another FAQ is clicked, the previous one will close automatically.
Visual Overview of the Logic:
Parent Accordion Component:

Holds all FAQ data.
Manages the state of which FAQ is active.
Passes down data and functions to control the behavior of each FAQ.
Child FAQ Component:

Receives individual FAQ data.
Knows if it's active based on the state from the parent.
Toggles its own state to show or hide the answer.
Bonus:
The code is structured to be reusable. You can easily add more FAQs by just updating the data, and the component will handle it automatically.

import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import faq  from "../API/faq.json";

export const Accordion = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);
  const[button,setButton]=useState("Show");

  useEffect(() => {
    setData(faq);
  }, []);





console.log(data);

// show and hide button functionality
const handleShowButton=()=>{
  setButton("Hide")
  
}


  return (
    <>
      <h1>The Accordion</h1>
      <ul className="section-accordion">
        {data.map((curElem) => {
          return (
            <li key={curElem.id}>
              <div className="accordion-grid">
                <p>{curElem.question}</p>
                <button onClick={()=>handleShowButton()}>{button}</button>
                
              </div>
              <p style={{display:button==="Show"?"none":"block"}}>{curElem.answer}</p>
            </li>
          );
        })}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
};




FAQ.jsx--
import { useState } from "react";

export const FAQ = ({ curData }) => {
  const { question, answer } = curData;
  const [activeId, setActiveId] = useState(false);

const handleButton=()=>{
    setActiveId(!activeId)
}

  return (
    <li>
      <div className="accordion-grid">
        <p>{question}</p>
        <button onClick={handleButton}>{activeId ? "close" : "Show"}</button>
      </div>
      <p>{activeId && answer}</p>
    </li>
  );
};

import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import faq  from "../API/faq.json";
import { FAQ } from "./UI/FAQ";

export const Accordion = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);


  useEffect(() => {
    setData(faq);
  }, []);





console.log(data);




  return (
    <>
      <h1>The Accordion</h1>
      <ul className="section-accordion">
        {data.map((curElem) => {
          return (
            <FAQ  key={curElem.id} curData={curElem} />
          );
        })}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
};
